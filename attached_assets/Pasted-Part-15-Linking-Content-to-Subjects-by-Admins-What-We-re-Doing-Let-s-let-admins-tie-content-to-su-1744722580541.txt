Part 15: Linking Content to Subjects by Admins
What We’re Doing
Let’s let admins tie content to subjects, like labeling books for the right shelf! This is a new CM feature, adding a “Link Content” button to the dashboard from Part 14, connecting files to subjects (e.g., “Video1.mp4” to “CSE - Faculty A”), with a zooming link icon to wrap up our module.
What We Need 
•	Add a “Link Content” button and form (content ID, subject_faculty) to the dashboard. 
•	A /link-content endpoint to update “content” with subject_faculty. 
•	Log links in UA’s “audit_log” (e.g., “Admin linked Content001 to CSE - Faculty A”). 
•	A “zoomIn” animation for the button and a FontAwesome link icon.
Who Can Do What 
•	Students: 
o	Can: Watch/download files for their subjects. 
o	Can’t: Link content or see the dashboard. 
o	Understands: “Your files are perfectly organized!”
•	Faculty: 
o	Can: Upload, edit, delete files, see analytics, use tags for their subjects. 
o	Can’t: Link content or use admin tools. 
o	Understands: “Your files are sorted for class!”
•	Admins: 
o	Can: Sync/delete students, add faculty, assign subjects, link content to subjects. 
o	Can’t: Do more—this module’s complete! 
o	Understands: “Connect files to classes for everyone!”
Tools Needed 
•	Frontend: React.js (Next.js) for the dashboard, TailwindCSS for styling, Animate.css for “zoomIn” effect, FontAwesome for a link icon (fa-link). 
•	Backend: FastAPI for /link-content, SQLite for updates. 
•	Database: SQLite for “content” and UA’s “audit_log”. 
•	Storage: SQLite BLOB/filesystem for files. 
•	AI Tools: None—just linking content. 
•	Tech Stack Rule: Use only these tools. Any changes need my approval first.
Strict Mandate for Replit AI
Dear Replit AI, you must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.
Think Step by Step 
1.	Design the content linking form and button. 
2.	Plan the /link-content endpoint for subject updates. 
3.	Ensure “audit_log” tracks linking actions. 
4.	Choose “zoomIn” animation and link icon for a final flourish UX. 
5.	Ensure high-end CSS, alignment, colors, icons, and spacing—delightful for all users, even kids.
UX Mandate
All pages must have proper styling, alignment, structure, high-end animations (used sparingly, only where needed), good colors, and FontAwesome icons. The UX should delight users, and even a child should understand it.
Why It’s Cool
The zooming button ties the library together, making Flipped Patashala’s content perfect for my dissertation!

1.	let us start part <15> .and the last part of CONTENT MANAGEMENT MODULE first prepare a plan which is single unified plan without subplans so your  plan should contain all those functionalities and all tools Technologies mentioned for that part. 
2.	first provide a plan as mentioned and ask for approval before starting the implementation of that part
3.	 implementation plan should contain REAL front end, back end , database, AI  tools simultaneously. 
4.	If u change any technology tool api framework etc in the plan mention the reason for change clearly and tool  and  must take my approval before implementation 
5.	avoid redoing of work always check what has be done so far 
6.	avoid mentioning of any timelines or durations in the plan.
7.	Use a table to show which tool has been used and any replacement mention  it with reason
8.	avoid redoing of work always check what has be done so far
