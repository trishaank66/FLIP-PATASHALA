Part 12: Letting Admins Remove Students from Content Access
What We’re Doing
Sometimes students leave, so let’s let admins close their library cards, stopping them from seeing content! This is a core CM feature, ensuring only current students (like “S001”) access files. We’ll add a “Remove Student” button to the admin dashboard from Part 11, using UA’s existing student deletion to update CM’s permissions (e.g., block “CSE” files). It’s about keeping CM’s library tidy, not redoing UA’s user removal. A zooming trash icon will make it clear!
What We Need 
•	Add a “Remove Student” button to the admin dashboard, showing a student table (e.g., “S001, CSE”). 
•	A CM-specific /remove-content-access endpoint that uses UA’s /delete-student to clear subjects_faculty in CM’s “content” access rules. 
•	Log actions in UA’s “audit_log” table (e.g., “Admin removed S001 from content”). 
•	A “zoomIn” animation for the button and a FontAwesome trash icon.
Who Can Do What 
•	Students: 
o	Can: Watch/download files if still enrolled. 
o	Can’t: Remove anyone or see the dashboard. 
o	Understands: “Your files are ready if you’re here!”
•	Faculty: 
o	Can: Upload, edit, delete files, see analytics, use tags. 
o	Can’t: Remove students or use admin tools. 
o	Understands: “Your content stays safe for active students!”
•	Admins: 
o	Can: Sync students (Part 11), remove students to block content access. 
o	Can’t: Delete faculty content directly—that’s for faculty. 
o	Understands: “Remove students to keep the library current!”
Tools Needed 
•	Frontend: React.js (Next.js) for the dashboard, TailwindCSS for styling, Animate.css for “zoomIn” effect, FontAwesome for a trash icon (fa-trash). 
•	Backend: FastAPI for /remove-content-access, SQLite to update access. 
•	Database: SQLite for CM’s “content” table, uses UA’s “users” and “audit_log”. 
•	Storage: None—just updating permissions. 
•	AI Tools: None—just access control. 
•	Tech Stack Rule: Use only these tools. Any changes need my approval first.
Strict Mandate for Replit AI
Dear Replit AI, you must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.

1.	let us start part <12> . of CONTENT MANAGEMENT MODULE first prepare a plan which is single unified plan without subplans so your  plan should contain all those functionalities and all tools Technologies mentioned for that part. 
2.	first provide a plan as mentioned and ask for approval before starting the implementation of that part
3.	 implementation plan should contain REAL front end, back end , database, AI  tools simultaneously. 
4.	If u change any technology tool api framework etc in the plan mention the reason for change clearly and tool  and  must take my approval before implementation 
5.	avoid redoing of work always check what has be done so far 
6.	avoid mentioning of any timelines or durations in the plan.
7.	Use a table to show which tool has been used and any replacement mention  it with reason
8.	avoid redoing of work always check what has be done so far
