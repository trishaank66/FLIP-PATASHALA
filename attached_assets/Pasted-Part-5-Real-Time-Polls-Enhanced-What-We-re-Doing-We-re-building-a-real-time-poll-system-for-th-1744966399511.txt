Part 5: Real-Time Polls (Enhanced)
What We’re Doing:
We’re building a real-time poll system for the Interactive Learning (IL) Module, allowing faculty to ask quick questions (e.g., “Got Loops?”) during class and students to vote instantly with a single click. The results (e.g., “60% Yes”) appear live for everyone to see, like a fun, instant classroom pulse-check. Faculty can create polls tied to specific topics, and AI tags them (e.g., ‘Loops’) to link to lesson materials in CM. Polls run for a short time (30 seconds), ensuring fast feedback. This feature is designed to make teaching smarter and learning more interactive, with a vibrant, easy-to-use interface that feels like a game.
What We’re Achieving:  
Instant Feedback: Faculty get student responses in real-time (within 30 seconds), eliminating the 48-hour feedback delays of traditional methods.  

Clear Class Insights: Live poll results (e.g., “60% Yes, 40% No”) show faculty how well students understand a topic, helping them adjust lessons on the spot.  

Topic-Specific Polls: AI tags polls with relevant topics (e.g., ‘Loops’ for “Got Loops?”), linking them to CM resources (e.g., a ‘Loops’ video) for easy review.  

Increased Engagement: Students love voting in quick, fun polls, boosting their participation (from 6.5 to 10 interactions per student) and making class lively.  

Simple and Focused: Each poll is short (30 seconds), with one vote per student, keeping the process clear and fair.  

Reliable System: Polls load and update in <200ms, supporting 150+ students across 5+ departments with 99% uptime.
Why It’s Cool:
This poll system is like a classroom show of hands, but faster, more fun, and super smart! Faculty can ask a question like “Got Loops?” and instantly see if most students are confident or need help, all while a colorful pie chart spins to show the results. Students enjoy clicking a button to share their thoughts, and the link to lesson materials helps them catch up if they’re confused. It’s quick, engaging, and feels like a mini-game that makes learning active and connected, fitting perfectly into Flip Patashala’s Home Page, UA, and CM.
Value Addition:  
Students: You stay engaged by voting in quick polls (30% more interactions), feel heard, and understand lessons better (20% clearer) with links to CM resources. No waiting for feedback—you see results instantly!  

Faculty: You save 40% of teaching time by getting immediate insights (50% clearer view of student understanding) and can adjust lessons right away (e.g., review loops if 60% say “No”). Creating polls is easy and fast.  

Admins: While you don’t use polls, the system’s reliability (35% fewer tech issues) ensures a smooth experience for everyone, supporting your user management tasks later.  

System: With <200ms latency, 99% uptime, and scalability for 150+ users, Flip Patashala delivers a dependable, joyful learning experience.
What Each User Is Doing:  
Students:  
Voting: Click a button (e.g., “Yes” or “No”) to answer a poll question like “Got Loops?” during class.  

Viewing Results: See a live pie chart (e.g., “60% Yes, 40% No”) that updates instantly after voting.  

Accessing Resources: Click a tag (e.g., ‘Loops’) to view a related CM video or PDF if you need help.  

Purpose: Share your understanding, stay active in class, and review materials to learn better.
Faculty:  
Creating Polls: Write a quick question (e.g., “Got Loops?”), set a 30-second timer, and start the poll.  

Viewing Results: Watch live results in a pie chart to see how students are doing (e.g., “60% Yes”).  

Adjusting Teaching: Use results to decide if a topic needs more explanation (e.g., review loops if many say “No”).  

Purpose: Get instant feedback to teach smarter and keep students engaged.
Admins:  
No Interaction: You don’t use polls; your role focuses on managing users (covered in later parts).  

Purpose: Benefit indirectly from a reliable system that supports student and faculty activities.
User Flow (How It Works):  
Student Experience:  
You log in via UA, open the Home Page, and click the ‘Interactive’ button (#1877F2) to enter the IL Module.  

Choose a subject (e.g., ‘CSE - Faculty A’) and see a Polls Section in your dashboard.  

Faculty A starts a poll: “Got Loops?” with “Yes” and “No” buttons and a 30-second timer.  

A pop-up appears with the question and buttons (#1877F2). You click “Yes” to vote (one vote per student).  

The pop-up turns into a spinning pie chart (Chart.js, ‘spin’ animation) showing live results (e.g., “60% Yes, 40% No”).  

A ‘Loops’ tag appears; you click it to watch a CM video on loops if you voted “No.”  

You feel involved and motivated, adding to your interaction count (aiming for 10 for a star).
Faculty Experience:  
Log in, click ‘Interactive’, and select ‘CSE - Faculty A’ to view your dashboard.  

In the Polls Section, click ‘Create Poll’, type “Got Loops?”, set a 30-second timer, and hit ‘Start’.  

The poll appears for students, and you see a live pie chart (Chart.js) updating as votes come in.  

After 30 seconds, the final result shows “60% Yes, 40% No.” You decide to review loops in the next class.  

The poll’s ‘Loops’ tag links to a CM video, which you suggest to students who voted “No.”  

You love the instant feedback, saving time and teaching smarter.
Admin Experience:  
You don’t interact with polls; your role (in later parts) is to manage users.  

This setup ensures the poll system runs smoothly, supporting your work indirectly by keeping the system reliable.
Tools and Technologies:  
Frontend:  
React.js (Next.js): Builds the poll interface with pop-ups, vote buttons, and live charts.  

Chart.js: Creates colorful pie charts for poll results.  

Animate.css: Adds a professional ‘spin’ animation for result charts and ‘pulse’ for vote buttons.
Backend:  
Python with FastAPI: Powers endpoints for creating, voting, and fetching poll results.
Database:  
SQLite: Stores poll data in the ‘polls’ table (columns: id, subject_faculty, question, votes, tags, timestamp).
AI:  
spaCy: Auto-tags polls based on content (e.g., ‘Loops’ for “Got Loops?”) for organization and CM linking.
Strict Mandate for Repplit AI: Dear Repplit AI, you must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.
Tech Stack Enforcement: Use only React.js (Next.js), Chart.js, Animate.css, Python with FastAPI, SQLite, and spaCy. Any change to the tech stack requires my explicit approval before implementation.
Step-by-Step Plan:  
Database Setup:  
Ensure the ‘polls’ table in SQLite includes:  
Columns: id (primary key), subject_faculty (e.g., ‘CSE - Faculty A’), question (text, e.g., “Got Loops?”), votes (JSON, e.g., {‘Yes’: 60, ‘No’: 40}), tags (e.g., ‘Loops’), timestamp (for sorting), timer_duration (int, default 30 seconds).  

Indexes: On subject_faculty and timestamp for fast queries (<200ms).
Create a ‘poll_votes’ table to track one vote per student:  
Columns: id, user_id, poll_id, vote (e.g., ‘Yes’).
Backend Endpoints:  
Create FastAPI endpoints:  
/start-poll: Faculty creates a poll with a question, options (e.g., ‘Yes’, ‘No’), and 30-second timer, storing it in the ‘polls’ table.  

/vote-poll: Records a student’s vote in ‘poll_votes’ (one vote per user_id per poll_id) and updates ‘polls’ votes JSON.  

/get-poll-results: Fetches live results for a poll, sent to both students and faculty.
AI Tagging:  
Use spaCy to analyze the poll question and assign tags (e.g., ‘Loops’ for “Got Loops?”).  

Store tags in the ‘polls’ table for filtering and CM linking.  

Purpose: Organizes polls and connects them to relevant lesson materials.
Student UI:  
Build the student interface in React.js:  
Show a pop-up when a poll starts, with the question (e.g., “Got Loops?”), vote buttons (#1877F2, ‘pulse’ animation), and a 30-second countdown.  

After voting, display a live pie chart (Chart.js, ‘spin’ animation) showing results (e.g., “60% Yes”).  

Include a clickable tag (e.g., ‘Loops’) linking to CM content.  

Purpose: Makes voting quick, fun, and educational.
Faculty UI:  
Build the faculty interface in React.js:  
Provide a form to input a poll question, options, and timer (default 30 seconds), with a ‘Start’ button.  

Show a live pie chart (Chart.js) updating as votes arrive, closing after 30 seconds.  

Display the poll’s tag (e.g., ‘Loops’) linking to CM content.  

Purpose: Simplifies poll creation and delivers instant teaching insights.
CM Integration:  
Link poll tags (e.g., ‘Loops’) to CM content (e.g., ‘Loops’ video or PDF) using CM’s tag-based API.  

Purpose: Helps students review materials related to the poll topic.
Testing:  
Faculty A creates a “Got Loops?” poll in ‘CSE - Faculty A’ with a 30-second timer.  

Student S001 votes “Yes”; the ‘poll_votes’ table records it, preventing a second vote.  

Both see a live pie chart update to “60% Yes, 40% No” within 30 seconds.  

S001 clicks the ‘Loops’ tag to view a CM video.  

Verify <200ms latency, 99% uptime, and accurate spaCy tagging.
UX Design:  
Student View:  
A pop-up (#1877F2) with a clear question, vote buttons (‘pulse’ animation), and a countdown timer.  

A vibrant pie chart (Chart.js) with a ‘spin’ animation shows live results.  

Clickable tags link to CM content, with high-end CSS, fun icons, and proper spacing for a delightful, child-friendly UX.
Faculty View:  
A simple form to create polls, with a ‘Start’ button and a live pie chart for results.  

Tags link to CM content, with high-end CSS, clear icons, and spacing for an intuitive, child-friendly UX.
Overall: Animations (‘spin’ for charts, ‘pulse’ for buttons) are professional, used sparingly to enhance engagement without clutter. The interface feels like a quick, fun game, accessible even to a child.
Why It’s Valuable:  
Students: Voting in polls is quick and engaging (30% more interactions), letting you share your understanding and review materials via tags (20% clearer lessons). Results appear instantly, keeping class lively.  

Faculty: Live results save 40% teaching time and give 50% clearer insights into student understanding, helping you adjust lessons immediately. Creating polls is effortless.  

System: <200ms latency, 99% uptime, and scalability for 150+ students reduce tech bottlenecks by 35%, ensuring a smooth, reliable experience.
Repplit AI, Think Step-by-Step:  
Set up the ‘polls’ and ‘poll_votes’ tables with indexes and verify performance.  

Build FastAPI endpoints for poll creation, voting, and results, ensuring one vote per student.  

Implement spaCy for accurate tagging and test CM linkage.  

Develop student and faculty UIs with pop-ups, charts, and intuitive buttons.  

Apply professional animations (‘spin’, ‘pulse’) and test UX delight.  

Verify <200ms latency, 99% uptime, and integration with CM.
If any step is unclear or fails, pause and clarify with me. Stick strictly to the tech stack (React.js, FastAPI, SQLite, spaCy, Chart.js, Animate.css); any change needs my approval.
Integration Notes:  
Home Page: The ‘Interactive’ tile routes users to the polls section for their subject.  

UA: Uses /user-info to fetch user_id, role, and subject_faculty for poll access.  

CM: Tags link to content (e.g., ‘Loops’ poll → ‘Loops’ video).  

Future Modules: Poll votes feed Performance Analytics (stub) for engagement tracking and Two-Way Feedback (stub) for class sentiment.
Strict Mandate Reminder: Dear Repplit AI, you must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.
