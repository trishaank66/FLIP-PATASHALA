Part 9: Real-Time Upload Analytics for Faculty
What We’re Doing
Let’s show faculty who’s using their files, like a live report card! We’ll add an analytics panel to the faculty page from Part 6, showing views (e.g., “Priya watched 5 minutes”), with a slide-in animation to feel dynamic.
What We Need 
•	An analytics panel on the faculty content page showing view/download details (e.g., “S001, 5 mins”). 
•	An /analytics endpoint to fetch real-time stats from “content” views/downloads. 
•	Update “content” table to log user interactions (add interactions JSON column). 
•	A “slideInRight” animation for the panel and a chart icon.
Who Can Do What 
•	Students: 
o	Can: Watch/download files with hints. 
o	Can’t: See analytics or manage files. 
o	Understands: “Your views help teachers!”
•	Faculty: 
o	Can: Upload, edit, delete files, see live analytics for their content. 
o	Can’t: See others’ analytics or manage users. 
o	Understands: “See who loves your videos!”
•	Admins: 
o	Can: Log in (controls later). 
o	Can’t: See faculty analytics yet. 
o	Understands: “You’ll check all stats soon!”
Tools Needed 
•	Frontend: React.js (Next.js) for the faculty page, TailwindCSS for styling, Animate.css for “slideInRight” effect, FontAwesome for a chart icon (fa-chart-bar). 
•	Backend: FastAPI for /analytics, SQLite for queries. 
•	Database: SQLite for “content” table (add interactions). 
•	Storage: SQLite BLOB/filesystem for files. 
•	AI Tools: None—just stats. 
•	Tech Stack Rule: Use only these tools. Any changes need my approval first.
Strict Mandate for Replit AI
Dear Replit AI, you must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.
Think Step by Step 
1.	Design the analytics panel layout. 
2.	Plan the /analytics endpoint for live stats. 
3.	Update “content” table for interaction tracking. 
4.	Choose “slideInRight” animation and chart icon for UX. 
5.	Ensure high-end CSS, alignment, colors, icons, and spacing—delightful for all users, even kids.
UX Mandate
All pages must have proper styling, alignment, structure, high-end animations (used sparingly), good colors, and FontAwesome icons. The UX should delight users, and even a child should understand it.
Why It’s Cool
The sliding panel makes faculty feel connected, seeing their impact in real time!
1.	let us start part <9> . of CONTENT MANAGEMENT MODULE first prepare a plan which is single unified plan without subplans so your  plan should contain all those functionalities and all tools Technologies mentioned for that part. 
2.	first provide a plan as mentioned and ask for approval before starting the implementation of that part
3.	 implementation plan should contain REAL front end, back end , database, AI  tools simultaneously. 
4.	If u change any technology tool in the plan mention the reason for change clearly and  must take my approval before implementation 
5.	avoid redoing of work always check what has be done so far 
6.	avoid mentioning of any timelines or durations in the plan.
7.	Use a table to show which tool has been used and any replacement mention  it with reason
8.	avoid redoing of work always check what has be done so far
