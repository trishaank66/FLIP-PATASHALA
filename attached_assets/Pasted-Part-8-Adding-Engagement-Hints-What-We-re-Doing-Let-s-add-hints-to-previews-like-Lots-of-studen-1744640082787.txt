Part 8: Adding Engagement Hints
What We’re Doing
Let’s add hints to previews, like “Lots of students love this video!” to make files more inviting. We’ll show simple stats (e.g., “65% liked this”) next to previews from Part 7, with a bounce animation to grab attention.
What We Need 
•	Add engagement hints to content lists (e.g., “65% liked” based on views/downloads). 
•	Update /get-content to calculate hints from view/download counts (mocked stats for now). 
•	Store hint data in the “content” table (add likes_percent column). 
•	A “bounceIn” animation for hints and a heart icon.
Who Can Do What 
•	Students: 
o	Can: See previews with hints, watch/download files. 
o	Can’t: Create hints or manage files. 
o	Understands: “This video’s popular—check it out!”
•	Faculty: 
o	Can: Upload, edit, delete files, see hints on their content. 
o	Can’t: Set hints or manage others’ files. 
o	Understands: “See what students like about your files!”
•	Admins: 
o	Can: Log in (controls later). 
o	Can’t: See hints or manage content yet. 
o	Understands: “Hints will help everyone soon!”
Tools Needed 
•	Frontend: React.js (Next.js) for content pages, TailwindCSS for styling, Animate.css for “bounceIn” effect, FontAwesome for a heart icon (fa-heart). 
•	Backend: FastAPI for /get-content with hint logic, SQLite for updates. 
•	Database: SQLite for “content” table (add likes_percent). 
•	Storage: SQLite BLOB/filesystem for files. 
•	AI Tools: None—just simple stats. 
•	Tech Stack Rule: Use only these tools. Any changes need my approval first.
Strict Mandate for Replit AI
Dear Replit AI, you must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.
Think Step by Step 
1.	Design hint displays next to previews. 
2.	Update /get-content for hint calculations. 
3.	Modify “content” table for hint storage. 
4.	Choose “bounceIn” animation and heart icon for UX. 
5.	Ensure high-end CSS, alignment, colors, icons, and spacing—delightful for all users, even kids.
UX Mandate
All pages must have proper styling, alignment, structure, high-end animations (used sparingly), good colors, and FontAwesome icons. The UX should delight users, and even a child should understand it.
Why It’s Cool
The bouncy hints make files feel special, encouraging students to dive in!

1.	let us start part <8> . of CONTENT MANAGEMENT MODULE first prepare a plan which is single unified plan without subplans so your  plan should contain all those functionalities and all tools Technologies mentioned for that part. 
2.	first provide a plan as mentioned and ask for approval before starting the implementation of that part
3.	 implementation plan should contain REAL front end, back end , database, AI  tools simultaneously etc
4.	If u change any technology tool in the plan mention the reason for change clearly and  must take my approval before implementation 
5.	avoid redoing of work always check what has be done so far 
6.	avoid mentioning of any timelines or durations in the plan.
7.	Use a table to show which tool has been used and any replacement mention  it with reason
8.	avoid redoing of work always check what has be done so far
9.	use pandas if needed  (we have already installed)
