User Flow (How It Works):  
Student Experience:  
You log in via UA, open the Home Page, and click the bright ‘Interactive’ button (#1877F2) to enter the IL Module.  

Choose a subject (e.g., ‘CSE - Faculty A’) and see a Forum Section with a chatroom.  

The chatroom shows posts as colorful bubbles (#1877F2), like “Help with Loops!” by S002, with tags (e.g., ‘Loops’) and a timestamp.  

A pinned post (e.g., “Great Loops explanation!”) sits at the top with a gold star.  

Type “I don’t get loop conditions!” and hit ‘Send’. Your post appears instantly with a ‘bounceIn’ animation, tagged ‘Loops’ by AI.  

A classmate replies, “Check this example!” and Faculty A adds, “Let’s review loops tomorrow.” You see their replies live.  

Click the ‘Loops’ tag to open a CM video on loops, helping you understand better.  

You feel supported and engaged, posting more to hit 10 interactions for a star!
Faculty Experience:  
Log in, click ‘Interactive’, and select ‘CSE - Faculty A’ to view the forum.  

See the chatroom with student posts, each tagged (e.g., ‘Loops’) and a mood insight in a sidebar (e.g., “Students seem stuck on Loops”).  

Post “What’s tricky about loops?” to spark discussion, or reply to S001’s question with a clear explanation.  

Pin S001’s great question with a gold star to highlight it for the class.  

Filter posts by ‘Loops’ to focus on that topic, noticing many students are confused.  

Use the AI insight to plan a loops review, saving time and teaching smarter.

This setup ensures the forum runs smoothly, supporting your work indirectly by keeping the system reliable.
Tools and Technologies:  
Frontend:  
React.js (Next.js): Creates the chatroom interface with live-updating bubbles and filters.  

Animate.css: Adds a professional ‘bounceIn’ animation for new posts and ‘pulse’ for the pin button.
Backend:  
Python with FastAPI: Powers endpoints for posting, replying, pinning, and fetching forum data.
Database:  
SQLite: Stores posts in the ‘forums’ table (columns: id, subject_faculty, post, tags, pinned, timestamp, user_id).
AI:  
spaCy: Auto-tags posts based on content (e.g., ‘Loops’ for “Help with Loops!”) for organization and CM linking.  

NLTK: Analyzes post sentiment to provide faculty with simple mood insights (e.g., “Students seem stuck”), mandatory for valuable teaching hints.
Strict Mandate for Repplit AI: Dear Repplit AI, you must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.
Tech Stack Enforcement: Use only React.js (Next.js), Animate.css, Python with FastAPI, SQLite, spaCy, and NLTK. Any change to the tech stack requires my explicit approval before implementation.
Step-by-Step Plan:  
Database Setup:  
Ensure the ‘forums’ table in SQLite includes:  
Columns: id (primary key), subject_faculty (e.g., ‘CSE - Faculty A’), post (text, e.g., “Help with Loops!”), tags (e.g., ‘Loops’), pinned (boolean), timestamp (for sorting), user_id (links to UA’s ‘users’ table).  

Foreign key: Link user_id to UA’s ‘users’ table for user identification.  

Indexes: On subject_faculty, tags, and timestamp for fast queries (<200ms).
Backend Endpoints:  
Create FastAPI endpoints:  
/forum-post: Saves new posts or replies, including user_id, post text, and timestamp.  

/pin-post: Toggles pinned status (True/False) for faculty to highlight posts.  

/get-forum: Fetches all posts for a subject_faculty, sorting pinned posts to the top.
AI Tagging:  
Use spaCy to analyze post content and assign relevant tags (e.g., ‘Loops’ for “Help with Loops!”).  

Store tags in the ‘forums’ table for filtering and CM linking.  

Purpose: Keeps discussions organized and connects posts to lesson materials.
AI Mood Insights:  
Implement NLTK to detect sentiment in posts (e.g., “Stuck?” or “Confused?”), generating simple, layman-friendly insights for faculty (e.g., “Students need help with Loops”).  

Display insights in the faculty UI sidebar, ensuring they’re actionable (e.g., prompting a review session).  

Purpose: Helps faculty understand student struggles quickly, enhancing teaching.
Student UI:  
Build the student interface in React.js:  
Show a chatroom with posts as bubbles (#1877F2), displaying username, timestamp, and tags (clickable to CM content).  

Highlight pinned posts at the top with a gold star icon.  

Add a text input and ‘Send’ button for posting/replying, with a ‘bounceIn’ animation for new posts.  

Purpose: Creates a fun, live chat experience that encourages participation.
Faculty UI:  
Build the faculty interface in React.js:  
Show the same chatroom, with a ‘Pin’ button (#1877F2, ‘pulse’ animation) for each post.  

Add a dropdown to filter posts by tags (e.g., ‘Loops’).  

Display a sidebar with NLTK mood insights (e.g., “Students seem stuck”).  

Purpose: Simplifies discussion management and provides teaching insights.
CM Integration:  
Link post tags (e.g., ‘Loops’) to CM content (e.g., ‘Loops’ video or PDF) using CM’s tag-based API.  

Purpose: Helps students access relevant resources directly from posts.
Testing:  
Student S001 posts “Help with Loops!” in ‘CSE - Faculty A’; it appears instantly with a ‘bounceIn’ animation and ‘Loops’ tag.  

Faculty A replies, pins S001’s post with a gold star, and sees it at the top.  

S001 clicks the ‘Loops’ tag to view a CM video.  

Faculty sees an NLTK insight (“Students seem stuck”) and filters ‘Loops’ posts.  

Verify <200ms latency, 99% uptime, accurate spaCy tagging, and NLTK insights.
UX Design:  
Student View:  
A vibrant chatroom (#1877F2) with bubbles showing posts, usernames, timestamps, and clickable tags.  

Pinned posts stand out at the top with a gold star.  

A clear text input and ‘Send’ button make posting easy, with a ‘bounceIn’ animation for new posts.  

High-end CSS, fun icons, and proper spacing create a delightful, child-friendly UX.
Faculty View:  
The same chatroom, with a ‘Pin’ button (‘pulse’ animation) for each post and a tag filter dropdown.  

A sidebar shows mood insights (e.g., “Students need help”) in simple language.  

High-end CSS, clear icons, and spacing ensure an intuitive, child-friendly UX.
Overall: Animations (‘bounceIn’ for posts, ‘pulse’ for buttons) are professional, used sparingly to enhance engagement without clutter. The interface feels like a friendly chat app, accessible even to a child.
Why It’s Valuable:  
Students: Instant answers boost your understanding (20% clearer) and keep you active (30% more interactions, aiming for 10). Tags link to CM resources, making lessons easier to grasp.  

Faculty: Live posts and AI insights save 40% planning time and give 50% clearer student insights, letting you teach smarter. Pinning keeps discussions focused.  

System: <200ms latency, 99% uptime, and scalability for 150+ students reduce tech bottlenecks by 35%, ensuring a smooth, reliable chatroom.
