LETS START WITH PART Part 8: Manually Adding Students
What We’re Doing
Sometimes admins want to add just one student, like welcoming a new friend. Let’s add a form to the dashboard from Part 7 for manual student entry, with a button that bounces to keep it fun.
What We Need 
•	A /manual-add-student endpoint to save one student with email, password, student ID, and department. 
•	A dashboard form with fields and an “Add Student” button. 
•	Save student with role=“student”, dept_id, and verification_pending=false (ID checked against CSV). 
•	A “bounce” animation for the button and a user-plus icon.
Who Can Do What 
•	Students: 
o	Can: Log in if added, see their group. 
o	Can’t: Add others or see the dashboard. 
o	Understands: “You’re in—enjoy learning!”
•	Faculty: 
o	Can: Log in if verified, see their group. 
o	Can’t: Add students or use admin tools. 
o	Understands: “More students for your class!”
•	Admins: 
o	Can: Log in, sync students, manually add students via form. 
o	Can’t: Delete students yet—that’s next! 
o	Understands: “Add one student at a time—easy!”
Tools Needed 
•	Frontend: React.js (Next.js) for the form, TailwindCSS for style, Animate.css for “bounce” effect, FontAwesome for a user-plus icon (fa-user-plus). 
•	Backend: FastAPI for /manual-add-student, Pandas for ID check. 
•	Database: SQLite to store students in “users”. 
•	AI Tools: Pandas for real CSV validation—no fakes!
Strict Mandate for Lovable AI
Lovable AI must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.
Think Step by Step 
1.	Design the manual add form layout. 
2.	Plan the /manual-add-student endpoint with ID verification. 
3.	Update “users” table for new students. 
4.	Choose “bounce” animation and user-plus icon for UX.
Why It’s Cool
The bouncy button gives admins flexibility, making every addition personal!



let us start part <8> . of the user authentication module .first prepare a plan single unified plan without subplans which contains all real tools api's frameworks as mentioned in that part information. so you are plan should contain all those functionalities and all tools Technologies mention for that part. first provide a plan as mentioned and ask for approval before starting the implementation of that part
implementation plan should contain REAL front end, back end , database, AI  tools simultaneously
