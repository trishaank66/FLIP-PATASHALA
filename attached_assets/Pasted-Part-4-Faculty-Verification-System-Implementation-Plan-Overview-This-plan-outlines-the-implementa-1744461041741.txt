Part 4: Faculty Verification System Implementation Plan
Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of the Faculty Verification System for Active Learn, allowing admins to approve faculty members who sign up on the platform.

Implementation Plan
1. Database Enhancements
Utilize PostgreSQL database (currently in use)
Add functionality to update user verification status
Leverage existing verification_logs table to track faculty approvals
2. Backend API Development (Express.js)
Create /api/verify-faculty endpoint for admin approval
Accept faculty ID and approval status
Implement authentication middleware to restrict access to admins
Update user verification status in database
Log verification action in verification_logs
Create /api/pending-faculty endpoint to retrieve list of pending faculty members
Return list of unverified faculty accounts for admin review
3. Frontend Components (React.js)
Develop AdminDashboard component with:
Faculty approval section with list of pending faculty
Verification button with "bounce" animation using Animate.css
User-check icon from react-icons (fa replacement)
Success/failure notifications
Create FacultyVerificationStatus component:
Display verification status for faculty members
Show "Approved!" message once verified
Include animated confirmation using Animate.css
4. State Management & Data Flow
Use React Query for data fetching and mutations
Implement toast notifications for action feedback
Create verification mutations with proper error handling
5. UI/UX Design (TailwindCSS)
Design responsive faculty verification dashboard
Implement bounce animation on verification button
Add user-check icon for verified faculty
Create distinct visual status indicators for pending/approved faculty
6. Role-Based Access Control
Enhance existing authentication system to restrict actions:
Students: Block access to admin features
Faculty: Show verification status but restrict admin actions
Admins: Full access to verification features
7. Testing & Validation
Create test faculty accounts to verify functionality
Test role-based restrictions
Validate database updates for faculty verification
