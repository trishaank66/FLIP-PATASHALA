mplementation Plan for Part 9: Deleting Students
Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a student deletion feature for the Active Learn platform's User Authentication Module, including audit logging, animations, and proper access controls.

Database Implementation
Add audit_log Table to Schema

Create audit_logs table in the PostgreSQL database with:
id: Auto-increment primary key
action: Text field for deletion records
user_id: Foreign key referencing users table
performed_by: Foreign key referencing admin user
timestamp: Datetime field for audit record creation
details: JSON field for additional context
Update Users Table Schema

Add is_active boolean field (default true) to the existing users table to mark deleted students instead of permanently removing them
Backend Implementation
Create Delete Student API Endpoint

Implement /api/delete-student endpoint in Express.js
Secure with admin middleware to prevent unauthorized access
Accept student ID in request body
Update user record to set is_active = false
Create audit log entry recording deletion action
Return success/failure response with appropriate status code
Update Authentication Flow

Modify existing login authentication to reject inactive users
Add logic to isAuthenticated middleware to check active status
Frontend Implementation
Admin Dashboard Enhancement

Add delete button with trash icon to student entries in admin dashboard
Implement confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions
Add visual indication for inactive/deleted students in listings
UI/UX Components

Create DeleteStudentButton component with zoomIn animation using Animate.css
Implement DeleteConfirmationDialog for safe deletion confirmation
Add trash icon from react-icons (as FontAwesome alternative)
Design success/error notifications for deletion operations
State Management

Update user queries to reflect student deletion status
Invalidate relevant queries after deletion to refresh UI
Add deleted status badge to student listings
Testing Plan
End-to-End Testing

Test deletion flow as admin user
Verify deleted students cannot log in
Confirm audit logs are properly created
Access Control Testing

Verify only admins can delete students
Ensure faculty cannot access deletion functionality
Implementation Tools
Frontend: React.js with TailwindCSS, Animate.css for zoomIn animation, react-icons for trash icon
Backend: Express.js with PostgreSQL for data storage
Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for database operations
Animation: Animate.css for zoomIn effect on the trash icon
State Management: TanStack Query for data fetching and cache invalidation
