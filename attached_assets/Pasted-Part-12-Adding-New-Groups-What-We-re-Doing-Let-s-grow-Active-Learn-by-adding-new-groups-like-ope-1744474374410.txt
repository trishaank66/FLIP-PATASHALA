Part 12: Adding New Groups
What We’re Doing
Let’s grow Active Learn by adding new groups, like opening new rooms in my dissertation! Admins will create groups (e.g., “AI Group”) for users from Parts 7–10, with a button that zooms in for thrill.
What We Need 
•	An /add-dept endpoint to save groups in “departments”. 
•	A dashboard “Add Group” button. 
•	Log additions in “audit_log” (e.g., “Admin added AI Group”). 
•	A “lightSpeedIn” animation for the button and a building icon.
Who Can Do What 
•	Students: 
o	Can: Log in, see their group. 
o	Can’t: Add groups or see the dashboard. 
o	Understands: “New groups mean more friends!”
•	Faculty: 
o	Can: Log in, see their group. 
o	Can’t: Create groups or use admin tools. 
o	Understands: “More groups to teach!”
•	Admins: 
o	Can: Log in, sync/add/delete students, add/delete faculty, add groups, verify faculty. 
o	Can’t: Delete groups yet—that’s next! 
o	Understands: “Create groups to organize everyone!”
Tools Needed 
•	Frontend: React.js (Next.js) for the dashboard, TailwindCSS for design, Animate.css for “lightSpeedIn” effect, FontAwesome for a building icon (fa-building). 
•	Backend: FastAPI for /add-dept, SQLite for updates. 
•	Database: SQLite for “departments” and “audit_log”. 
•	AI Tools: None—just expanding groups.
Strict Mandate for Lovable AI
Lovable AI must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.
Think Step by Step 
1.	Design the “departments” table for new groups. 
2.	Plan the /add-dept endpoint for saving groups. 
3.	Ensure “audit_log” tracks additions. 
4.	Choose “lightSpeedIn” animation and building icon for UX.
Why It’s Cool
The zooming button makes growing Active Learn thrilling, organizing users better!
let us start part <13> . of the user <authentication module> .first prepare a plan  which single unified plan without subplans which contains all real tools api's frameworks as mentioned in that “part”information. so you are plan should contain all those functionalities and all tools Technologies mention for that part. first provide a plan as mentioned and ask for approval before starting the implementation of that part.scrictly confine to given technologies,tool,apis given in the prompt above


implementation plan should contain REAL front end, back end , database, AI  tools simultaneously
