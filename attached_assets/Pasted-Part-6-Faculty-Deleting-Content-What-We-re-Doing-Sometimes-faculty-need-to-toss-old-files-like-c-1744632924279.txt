Part 6: Faculty Deleting Content
What We’re Doing
Sometimes faculty need to toss old files, like clearing a cluttered desk. Let’s add “Delete” buttons to their content page from Part 5, with a 5-minute undo option, and a trash icon that zooms in for impact.
What We Need 
•	Add “Delete” buttons to the faculty content list. 
•	A /delete-content endpoint to mark files as deleted (add last_deleted timestamp). 
•	An /undo-delete endpoint to restore files within 5 minutes. 
•	A “zoomIn” animation for buttons and a trash icon.
Who Can Do What 
•	Students: 
o	Can: Watch/download available files. 
o	Can’t: Delete or see faculty pages. 
o	Understands: “Your files are always current!”
•	Faculty: 
o	Can: Upload, edit, delete their files (undo within 5 minutes). 
o	Can’t: Delete others’ files or manage users. 
o	Understands: “Remove old stuff—undo if you change your mind!”
•	Admins: 
o	Can: Log in (controls later). 
o	Can’t: Delete faculty content yet. 
o	Understands: “Faculty are keeping things tidy!”
Tools Needed 
•	Frontend: React.js (Next.js) for the faculty page, TailwindCSS for styling, Animate.css for “zoomIn” effect, FontAwesome for a trash icon (fa-trash). 
•	Backend: FastAPI for /delete-content and /undo-delete, SQLite for updates. 
•	Database: SQLite for “content” table (add last_deleted). 
•	Storage: SQLite BLOB/filesystem for file management. 
•	AI Tools: None—just deleting. 
•	Tech Stack Rule: Use only these tools. Any changes need my approval first.
Strict Mandate for Replit AI
Dear Replit AI, you must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.
Think Step by Step 
1.	Add “Delete” buttons to the faculty content list. 
2.	Plan the /delete-content endpoint with undo logic. 
3.	Update “content” table for deletion tracking. 
4.	Choose “zoomIn” animation and trash icon for UX. 
5.	Ensure high-end CSS, alignment, colors, icons, and spacing—delightful for all users, even kids.
UX Mandate
All pages must have proper styling, alignment, structure, high-end animations (used sparingly), good colors, and FontAwesome icons. The UX should delight users, and even a child should understand it.
Why It’s Cool
The zooming trash button with undo feels safe, letting faculty manage content confidently!

1.	let us start part <6> . of CONTENT MANAGEMENT MODULE first prepare a plan which is single unified plan without subplans so your  plan should contain all those functionalities and all tools Technologies mentioned for that part. 
2.	first provide a plan as mentioned and ask for approval before starting the implementation of that part
3.	 implementation plan should contain REAL front end, back end , database, AI  tools simultaneously. 
4.	If u change any technology tool in the plan mention the reason for change clearly and  must take my approval before implementation 
5.	avoid redoing of work always check what has be done so far 
6.	avoid mentioning of any timelines or durations in the plan.
7.	Use a table to show which tool has been used and any replacement mention  it with reason
8.	avoid redoing of work always check what has be done so far
