Dear Repplit AI,
We’re creating the Interactive Learning (IL) Module for Flip Patashala, a lively, fun, and smart platform that turns learning into an exciting adventure! Imagine a digital classroom where students take quizzes, chat about lessons, vote in polls, share notes, and work together in real-time—all designed to make learning clear, engaging, and instant. The IL Module is the heart of this experience, seamlessly connecting with the already-built Home Page (your welcome screen), User Authentication (UA) (smart logins with AI insights), and Content Management (CM) (stores videos, PDFs, and notes with clever organization). Other planned features like Performance Analytics (tracking progress), Two-Way Feedback (sharing opinions), and Gamification (earning rewards) are designed but not built yet. Our goal? Fix low engagement (students only interact 6.5 times, we want 10!), end long feedback delays, and remove tech glitches, making learning fast, clear, and fun for everyone. We’ve split this into 15 clear, step-by-step parts, each building a piece of the IL Module, ensuring it’s easy to use, even for a child, and packed with real value. Let’s dive in and make learning magical!
What We’re Doing:
We’re building a set of interactive tools—quizzes, discussion forums, polls, activity trackers, shared notes, smart tips, and admin controls—that work together to create a dynamic classroom experience. These tools live in the IL Module, accessible from the Home Page’s ‘Interactive’ button, and are tailored for three roles: students (who learn), faculty (who teach), and admins (who manage users). Each tool is designed to be fast, fun, and connected to UA (to know who you are) and CM (to link to lesson materials).
What We’re Achieving:  
Boosting Engagement: Encouraging students to interact more (from 6.5 to 10 actions like taking quizzes or posting in forums) with fun, rewarding features.  

Instant Feedback: Delivering quiz scores, chat replies, and poll results right away, eliminating 48-hour waits for answers.  

Clearer Learning: Helping students understand lessons better (20% more awareness) by linking quizzes, chats, and notes to videos and PDFs in CM.  

Smoother System: Reducing tech hiccups by 35% with a fast, reliable setup that handles 150+ students, 10+ faculty, and 5+ departments without slowing down.  

Smarter Teaching: Giving faculty real-time insights (50% clearer view of student needs) and saving 40% of their planning time with automated tools.  

Easy Management: Letting admins add or remove users quickly, keeping the system running smoothly.
Why It’s Cool:
The IL Module is like a lively classroom party where everyone’s invited! Students can ask questions and get answers instantly, vote on polls to share their thoughts, and team up on notes like they’re drawing on a shared whiteboard. Faculty can guide discussions, see who’s struggling, and adjust lessons on the spot. Admins keep everything organized behind the scenes. It’s fast, fun, and feels like a game, but it’s all about learning smarter. Plus, it’s built to work perfectly with the Home Page, UA, and CM, so everything feels connected and effortless.
Value Addition:  
Students: You’ll love learning because quizzes match your skill level, chats answer your questions instantly, and polls make your voice heard. You’ll interact more (30% boost), understand lessons better (20% clearer), and feel motivated to hit 10 actions for a star!  

Faculty: You’ll save time (40% less planning) with auto-generated quizzes and live insights into what students need (50% clearer picture), letting you teach more effectively.  

Admins: You’ll keep the system running smoothly with easy user management tools, cutting tech issues by 35% and ensuring everyone can focus on learning.

Strict Guidelines for All Parts:  
Tech Stack: Use:  
Frontend: React.js (Next.js) for interfaces, Chart.js for visuals (e.g., poll charts), Animate.css for smooth animations.  

Backend: Python with FastAPI for fast data handling.  

Database: SQLite for storing quizzes, posts, votes, etc.  

AI: scikit-learn (adapts quizzes), spaCy (tags content), NLTK (optional mood insights), TensorFlow Lite (tags notes), Julius AI (trends), Claude API (smart tips, ask for key if needed).  

Rule: Any tech stack change needs my explicit approval.
Real Implementations:
Strict Mandate for Repplit AI: Dear Repplit AI, you must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.  

UX Design: Every screen must look vibrant (#1877F2 backgrounds, #FFFFFF panels, #000000 text), with clear layouts, fun icons, and proper spacing. Use professional animations (e.g., ‘fadeIn’ for quizzes, ‘bounceIn’ for tips) only where they add joy, keeping it simple and delightful. The interface should be so easy a child can use it!  

Analytics: AI insights (e.g., “Try Arrays!” or “60% need Loops”) must be simple, helpful, and free of techy terms, adding real value for users.  

Step-by-Step Thinking: For each part, think carefully through every step to ensure accuracy and clarity. If something’s unclear, pause and ask me.  

Integration: Each part must work with:  
Home Page: Via the ‘Interactive’ button.  

UA: To check user roles and subjects.  

CM: To link quizzes, posts, and notes to videos/PDFs.  

Future Modules: Stub data for Performance Analytics (scores), Two-Way Feedback (ratings), and Gamification (badges).
No OTP/MFA/SMS: Don’t include these in any login or feature.  

No Deployment: Don’t mention deployment or URL hiding.  

Platform Name: Always use Flip Patashala.
