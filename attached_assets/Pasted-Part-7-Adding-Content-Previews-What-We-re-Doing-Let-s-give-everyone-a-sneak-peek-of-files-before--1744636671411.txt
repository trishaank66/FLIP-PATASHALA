Part 7: Adding Content Previews
What We’re Doing
Let’s give everyone a sneak peek of files before they watch or download, like a movie trailer! We’ll add previews (e.g., video thumbnails, PDF first pages) to the student and faculty content pages from Parts 1–6, with a fade-in animation to draw attention.
What We Need 
•	Add preview displays (thumbnails for MP4, page 1 for PDF/PPT) to content lists. 
•	Update /get-content to include preview data (e.g., thumbnail URL). 
•	Store previews in the “content” table (add preview_url column). 
•	A “fadeIn” animation for previews and a search icon.
Who Can Do What 
•	Students: 
o	Can: See previews, watch/download files for their group. 
o	Can’t: Create previews or manage files. 
o	Understands: “Peek at videos before watching!”
•	Faculty: 
o	Can: Upload, edit, delete files, see previews of their content. 
o	Can’t: Preview others’ files or manage users. 
o	Understands: “Check how your files look!”
•	Admins: 
o	Can: Log in (controls later). 
o	Can’t: Preview content yet. 
o	Understands: “You’ll see all previews soon!”
Tools Needed 
•	Frontend: React.js (Next.js) for content pages, TailwindCSS for styling, Animate.css for “fadeIn” effect, FontAwesome for a search icon (fa-search). 
•	Backend: FastAPI for /get-content with previews, SQLite for updates. 
•	Database: SQLite for “content” table (add preview_url). 
•	Storage: SQLite BLOB/filesystem for preview files. 
•	AI Tools: None—just previews. 
•	Tech Stack Rule: Use only these tools. Any changes need my approval first.
Strict Mandate for Replit AI
Dear Replit AI, you must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.
Think Step by Step 
1.	Design preview displays for MP4/PDF/PPT. 
2.	Update /get-content for preview URLs. 
3.	Modify “content” table for preview storage. 
4.	Choose “fadeIn” animation and search icon for UX. 
5.	Ensure high-end CSS, alignment, colors, icons, and spacing—delightful for all users, even kids.
UX Mandate
All pages must have proper styling, alignment, structure, high-end animations (used sparingly), good colors, and FontAwesome icons. The UX should delight users, and even a child should understand it.
Why It’s Cool
The fading previews make choosing content exciting, boosting curiosity for Active Learn!
1.	let us start part <7> . of CONTENT MANAGEMENT MODULE first prepare a plan which is single unified plan without subplans so your  plan should contain all those functionalities and all tools Technologies mentioned for that part. 
2.	first provide a plan as mentioned and ask for approval before starting the implementation of that part
3.	 implementation plan should contain REAL front end, back end , database, AI  tools simultaneously. 
4.	If u change any technology tool in the plan mention the reason for change clearly and  must take my approval before implementation 
5.	avoid redoing of work always check what has be done so far 
6.	avoid mentioning of any timelines or durations in the plan.
7.	Use a table to show which tool has been used and any replacement mention  it with reason
8.	avoid redoing of work always check what has be done so far
