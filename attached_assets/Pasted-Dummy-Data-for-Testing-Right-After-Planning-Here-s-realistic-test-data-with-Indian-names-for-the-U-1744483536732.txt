Dummy Data for Testing
Right After Planning
Here’s realistic test data with Indian names for the UA Module, matching the original prompt:
Users Table (150 students, 10 faculty, 2 admins):  
Students:  
ID: S001, Email: priya.sharma@activelearn.com, Password: (hashed), Role: student, Dept_ID: 1 (CSE), Verification_Pending: false, Status: active  

ID: S002, Email: arjun.mehta@activelearn.com, Role: student, Dept_ID: 2 (IT), Verification_Pending: false, Status: active  

ID: S003, Email: neha.verma@activelearn.com, Role: student, Dept_ID: 3 (ECE), Verification_Pending: false, Status: active  

... (147 more, like Rahul, Anjali, Vikram)
Faculty:  
ID: F001, Email: prof.rao@activelearn.com, Role: faculty, Dept_ID: 1 (CSE), Verification_Pending: false, Status: active  

ID: F002, Email: dr.meena@activelearn.com, Role: faculty, Dept_ID: 2 (IT), Verification_Pending: false, Status: active  

... (8 more, like Prof. Gupta, Dr. Singh)
Admins:  
ID: A001, Email: admin.kumar@activelearn.com, Role: admin, Dept_ID: null, Verification_Pending: false, Status: active  

ID: A002, Email: admin.lal@activelearn.com, Role: admin, Dept_ID: null, Verification_Pending: false, Status: active
Departments Table:  
ID: 1, Name: CSE  

ID: 2, Name: IT  

ID: 3, Name: ECE  

ID: 4, Name: MECH  

ID: 5, Name: CIVIL
CSV File (students.csv):  
ID,Email,Role,Department
S001,priya.sharma@activelearn.com,student,CSE
S002,arjun.mehta@activelearn.com,student,IT
S003,neha.verma@activelearn.com,student,ECE
... (147 more rows for 150 students)
Audit Log Table (Sample):  
ID: 1, Action: “Admin added Prof. Rao”, User_ID: A001  

ID: 2, Action: “Admin removed S002”, User_ID: A001
How to Use It: Test registration, verification, login, syncing students, managing faculty, adjusting groups, and viewing insights (e.g., “CSE is growing—add students!”).
Verification of Features
All features from the original prompt are included:  
Separate Login/Register Pages: Parts 1, 2 (with Back to Home fix).  

Role-Specific Verification: Parts 3–5 (students via CSV, faculty via admin, admins via code).  

Enrollment Sync: Part 7 (CSV import).  

Manual Controls: Parts 8, 10 (add students, faculty).  

Deletions: Parts 9, 11, 13, 14 (students, faculty, groups, self).  

Security: Across parts (bcrypt hashing, PyJWT sessions, audit logs, rate limiting implied in backend).  

AI Insights: Part 15 (scikit-learn for groups, Pandas for inactivity, Claude API for suggestions).  

Back to Home Fix: Parts 1, 2 (buttons redirect to /home).  

Integration: All parts feed user data (role, dept_id) to Home Page, stubbed for CM, IL, etc.  

UI/UX: High-end animations (fadeIn, pulse, etc.) and FontAwesome icons in every part.
Removed: MFA, OTP, Twilio API, as requested.
Enhanced: Paid Claude API key for real insights, simplified verification, and layman-friendly AI tips.
Notes for Lovable AI
No Coding Yet: This is a planning blueprint—don’t build anything now!  

UA Module Only: Focus on authentication—no content management or other features beyond stubs.  

Must Look Amazing: Use Animate.css for animations and FontAwesome for icons—make it visually stunning!  

Real Tools: Run actual scikit-learn, Pandas, and Claude API (paid key)—no mocks or fake results.  

Simple Insights: AI tips must be clear, like “Add more CSE students!”—no tech jargon, real value for admins.  

Dissertation Context: This is for my M.Tech dissertation at BITS Pilani, called Active Learn.  

Future Prep: Stubs for holographic feedback and adaptive learning, but no details.
