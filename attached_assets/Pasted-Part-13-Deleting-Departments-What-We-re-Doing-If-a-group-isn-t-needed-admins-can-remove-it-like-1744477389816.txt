Part 13: Deleting Departments
What We’re Doing
If a group isn’t needed, admins can remove it, like folding a map. Let’s add a “Delete Group” button to the dashboard from Part 12, updating users and logging it, to keep the system tidy.
What We Need 
•	A /delete-dept endpoint to remove groups from “departments”. 
•	Update “users” to clear dept_id for affected users. 
•	Log deletions in “audit_log” (e.g., “Admin removed MECH”). 
•	A “fadeInUp” animation for the button and a times-circle icon.
Who Can Do What 
•	Students: 
o	Can: Log in if their group exists, see their group. 
o	Can’t: Delete groups or see the dashboard. 
o	Understands: “Your group is safe—keep going!”
•	Faculty: 
o	Can: Log in if their group exists, see their group. 
o	Can’t: Delete groups or use admin tools. 
o	Understands: “Groups updated for teaching!”
•	Admins: 
o	Can: Log in, sync/add/delete students, add/delete faculty, add/delete groups, verify faculty. 
o	Can’t: Delete themselves yet—almost there! 
o	Understands: “Remove groups to streamline things!”
Tools Needed (STRCILTY USE SAME TOOLS)
•	Frontend: React.js (Next.js) for the dashboard, TailwindCSS for style, Animate.css for “fadeInUp” effect, FontAwesome for a times-circle icon (fa-times-circle). 
•	Backend: FastAPI for /delete-dept, SQLite for updates. 
•	Database: SQLite for “departments”, “users”, and “audit_log”. 
•	AI Tools: None—just tidying up.
Strict Mandate for Lovable AI
Lovable AI must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.
Think Step by Step 
1.	Plan the /delete-dept endpoint for safe removal. 
2.	Update “users” to handle dept_id changes. 
3.	Ensure “audit_log” tracks deletions. 
4.	Choose “fadeInUp” animation and times-circle icon for UX.
Why It’s Cool
The fading button keeps things clean, flowing from group creation for a neat system!

let us start part <13> . of the user <authentication module> .first prepare a plan  which single unified plan without subplans which contains all real tools api's frameworks as mentioned in that “part”information. so you are plan should contain all those functionalities and all tools Technologies mention for that part. first provide a plan as mentioned and ask for approval before starting the implementation of that part.scrictly confine to given technologies,tool,apis given in the prompt above


implementation plan should contain REAL front end, back end , database, AI  tools simultaneously

Tools Needed 
•	Frontend: React.js (Next.js) for the dashboard, TailwindCSS for style, Animate.css for “slideInLeft” effect, FontAwesome for a user-minus icon (fa-user-minus). 
•	Backend: FastAPI for /delete-faculty, SQLite for updates. 
•	Database: SQLite for “users” and “audit_log”. 
•	AI Tools: None—just managing faculty.
USE THE SAME TOOLS AS MENTIONED ABOVE IN PLANNAING AND IMPLEMENATION
