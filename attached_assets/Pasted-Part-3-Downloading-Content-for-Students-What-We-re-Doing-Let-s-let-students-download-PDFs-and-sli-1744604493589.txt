Part 3: Downloading Content for Students
What We’re Doing
Let’s let students download PDFs and slideshows, like grabbing a study guide to keep! This is a new CM feature, adding “Download” buttons to the list from Part 2, with a bounce animation to make it fun.
What We Need 
•	Add “Download” buttons for PDFs and PPTs on the student content page. 
•	Update /get-content to serve downloadable files. 
•	Add a downloads column to the “content” table to track downloads. 
•	A “bounce” animation for buttons and a FontAwesome download icon.
Who Can Do What 
•	Students: 
o	Can: Click “Watch” to view or “Download” PDFs/PPTs for their group. 
o	Can’t: Upload or edit files—just use them. 
o	Understands: “Save your notes with one tap!”
•	Faculty: 
o	Can: Log in (upload next). 
o	Can’t: Download student files or manage yet. 
o	Understands: “Students will love your files soon!”
•	Admins: 
o	Can: Log in (controls later). 
o	Can’t: Download content yet—more coming! 
o	Understands: “You’ll manage downloads later!”
Tools Needed 
•	Frontend: React.js (Next.js) for the student page, TailwindCSS for styling, Animate.css for “bounce” effect, FontAwesome for a download icon (fa-download). 
•	Backend: FastAPI for /get-content downloads, SQLite for tracking. 
•	Database: SQLite to update “content” table (add downloads). 
•	Storage: SQLite BLOB/filesystem for file access. 
•	AI Tools: None—just downloading. 
•	Tech Stack Rule: Use only these tools. Any changes need my approval first.
Strict Mandate for Replit AI
Dear Replit AI, you must always use real, fully functional implementations for all tools, technologies, frameworks, and APIs, including AI, ML, DL, DS, CV, and others. Simulated, mocked, fake, placeholder, hardcoded, or dummy responses are strictly forbidden. All computations, data processing, and API calls must be genuine, executed in real-time with actual systems, producing verifiable results. This rule is absolute and enforced for every operation, with no exceptions.
Think Step by Step 
1.	Add “Download” buttons to the content list design. 
2.	Update /get-content for download logic. 
3.	Modify “content” table to track downloads. 
4.	Choose “bounce” animation and download icon for a playful UX. 
5.	Ensure high-end CSS, alignment, colors, icons, and spacing—delightful for all users, even kids.
UX Mandate
All pages must have proper styling, alignment, structure, high-end animations (used sparingly, only where needed), good colors, and FontAwesome icons. The UX should delight users, and even a child should understand it.

strictly avoid redoing of work always check what has be done so far
Why It’s Cool
The bouncy buttons make downloading feel like collecting goodies, boosting student engagement!
let us start part <3> . of CONTENT MANAGEMENT MODULE Downloading Content for Students  first prepare a plan which is single unified plan without subplans which contains all real tools Api’s frameworks as mentioned in that part information. so you are plan should contain all those functionalities and all tools Technologies mention for that part. first provide a plan as mentioned and ask for approval before starting the implementation of that part implementation plan should contain REAL front end, back end , database, AI  tools simultaneously. 

If u change any technology tool in the plan mention the reason for change clearly and  must take my approval before implementation
